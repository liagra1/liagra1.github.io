Hello, my name is Liam Graham, and I am a current student at Lawrence University. I am majoring in Business, and minoring in both Economics and Data Statistics and Sciences. I also play for the Lawrence University men's basketball team. This website contains my resume, as well as numerous projects that I've done throughout my economics and data science classes.
