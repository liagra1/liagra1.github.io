This section contains some of the projects that I have completed for both Economics and Data Science classes. The Economics projects were all completed using Microsoft Excel (most files also involve the use of VBA code), and the Data Statistics projects were completed using R-Studio (now known as Posit Cloud).

This project concerns the correlation that both minutes-per-game and player position has or does not have on the points-per-game of NBA players in the 2018-2019 season. This project was made using R-Studio, now known as Posit Cloud.
